From the last experiment (polilean_NL, previous Dutch national elections)

Have the models changed their leaning?
Do the models vote for different parties now that it's about EU rather than NL (national) vote?

This experiment

Quantitative

Are there specific topics that the models are ambigious about? (sometimes agree, sometimes disagree)
Are there any topics that one of the models has a very strong opinion about? (e.g. always agree or disagree)
Are the models consistent/reliable in their responses to the statements (even though keeping temperature low) or are the respones still varied?

Qualitative

What are the answers that the models give on contentious topics (where there is the highest variability across the board)?
